# NM_Sharon_DS

**Decoding Emotions through Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Conversations**
👤 Author: Sharon Cynthiya J

## 📘 Overview

This project investigates how sentiment analysis techniques can be applied to social media text to identify and interpret emotional patterns in digital conversations. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, the system processes textual data, classifies sentiment, and evaluates model performance through standard machine-learning metrics.

The focus of the project is on building an interpretable sentiment analysis pipeline and comparing multiple classification approaches rather than optimizing for a single model.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* 🐍 Python 3
* 📊 Pandas, NumPy for data processing
* 🧠 NLTK / TextBlob for sentiment analysis
* 🤖 Scikit-learn for model training and evaluation
* 📈 Matplotlib for visualization

## 🔄 Workflow

1. Load and preprocess social media text data
2. Clean and normalize textual input
3. Extract sentiment features
4. Train and compare multiple classification models
5. Evaluate performance using accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC curves

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ▶️ Running the Project

Run the main analysis script:

```
python src/sentiment_emotion_analysis.py
```

Ensure the dataset is present in the `data/` directory before execution.

## 📊 Results and Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using multiple metrics, including accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrices, and ROC curves. Comparative analysis across different classifiers highlights trade-offs between accuracy and generalization.

Representative evaluation outputs are available in the `outputs/` directory and can be regenerated by running the analysis pipeline.

## 🎯 Use Cases

* Brand sentiment and reputation monitoring
* Public opinion and social trend analysis
* Emotional pattern detection in digital communication
* Foundational sentiment module for conversational AI systems

## 📌 Current Status

* ✅ Dataset preprocessing completed
* ✅ Sentiment analysis pipeline implemented
* ✅ Multiple models trained and evaluated
* ✅ Baseline visualizations generated

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Multi-class emotion classification beyond polarity
* Integration of transformer-based NLP models
* Enhanced visualization and reporting
* Real-time sentiment analysis from streaming data sources
